# Light theme

- Darkish Atom ui theme that works we with notebooks in changing light situations
- Idea is to have a super minimal design yet pleasing to the eye.

Syntax theme for the screenshot is Monokai

Todo:
- The project header in the file tree should not be highlighted
- The symbol of the git status could be shown instead of the standard file symbol. That would alow to show the file title in normal text colour.
