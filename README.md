# East End theme

- The dea is to have a simple design that works well on a notebook in different light conditions.
- Darkish Atom ui theme that works well with notebooks in changing light situations

Todo:
- The project header in the file tree should not be highlighted if the treeview is not in use
- The symbol of the git status could be shown instead of the standard file symbol. That would allow to show the file title in normal text colour.
- Only show selected file in treeview as highlighted in treeview if treeview is activated

Any pointers as to how to resolve this are welcome.
